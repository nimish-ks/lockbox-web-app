# About Lockbox

### What is lockbox?

Lockbox is a tool to privately and securely share secrets such as sensitve notes, account credentials or code snippets using true end-to-end encryption.

### How does it work?

Lockbox works by leveraging modern browsers' native [WebCrypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) in a 100% serverless model. What this means is that all boxes are encrypted and decrypted entirely within the sender's or recipient's browser respectively.
